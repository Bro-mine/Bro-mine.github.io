	  <h2>Some info</h2>
	  <p>This website exists for the sole (mostly) purpose of documenting my experiments within software development. For software I develop, this website will serve as a place to log changes, and document future plans.</p>
	  <p>I would be inaccurate, however, if I did only mention that this is the sole purpose of this website. Logically, that is, indeed, the main purpose for this, albeit not the only one. Since Github is hosting this, and not me, it'd be crass if it didn't involve software. More information can be found in the README somewhere on this page.
	  <p>In terms of software development, I mostly prefer things at a lower level. Developing websites does not seem as interesting as developing software for microcontrolers, as an example. The hardware I own is not that niche, and I'm not yet sure if whatever I'll be doing will involve it.

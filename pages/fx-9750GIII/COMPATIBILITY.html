	<h1>Compatibility with other calculators</h1>
	<br>
	<p>Though this section ofthe website is described as being dedicated to the fx-9750GIII model of calculator (which is equivalent to the Graph 35-E II, if you are located in France or somewhere else that labels the Casio calculators this way), the things described here probably work for most posterior models, and might work for older models of calculators as well. It is important to check the software and hardware manuals for your calculator to identify any possible discrepancies).</p>

	<p>The fx-9750GIII was introduced in 2020, more or less, while the fx-9750G is part of the 9850 series, which spanned from 1996 to 2008. I suppose the fx-9750GIII is very similar to the fx-9860GIII, but I do not own the latter (or any other graphing calculator, for that matter), and as such, I will not speculate on their differences. The lesson to be taken from this, is that any similarity between two models of calculators could be significant or not, and that cannot be deduced without checking the user manuals. Casio has been producing different models of calculators for some decades now, and it is only expected they will be different.</p>

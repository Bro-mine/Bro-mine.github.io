I am in possession of a Casio fx-9750GIII (a graphing calculator) and here you will find some things I have to say about it, as well as some projects I have done in regards to it.

It is a good calculator in general, and I decided to acquire it specifically because it seemed like a good compromise between something that works well, and that isn't too expensive (unlike the more modern PRIZM calculators). While I do maintain that opinion, not everything is perfect.

The online resources for this calculator model are pretty scarce, even more so in english. There are not many programs around, and almost no material in terms of programming for this calculator. Not many guides exist that go beyond the most basic functions it has, and although the manual is pretty resourceful, it does not cover everything this specific model is capable of, in detail.

As such, I have decided to document whatever I manage to learn about this calculator in this section of the website. This model of calculator can be programmed using MicroPython and Casio BASIC, and probably C or Assembly as well, although finding a compiler for it or an assembler that would work with its processor architecture could be challenging. I will probably look into Casio BASIC first, since that seems more "integrated" with the calculator, though MicroPython could be better, since it is possible to run it in other machines.

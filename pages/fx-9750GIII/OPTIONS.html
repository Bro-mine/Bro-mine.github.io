	<h1>Options and choices for developing programs on the fx-9750GIII</h1>
	<br>
	<p>Developing programs in this calculator can be done in a few different ways. The fx-9750GIII comes with Casio Basic as its "main language", native to most, if not all, Casio calculators, and MicroPython. It can also be programmed in Assembly and C, most likely.</p>
	<h2>MicroPython</h2>
		<p>MicroPython being included is a great advantage, as it can also run on other computers running Python. It means the programs written in it can be ported easily to, and from the calculator. The version of MicroPython that has been adapted to run on this calculator is slightly different than the Python you will find running on other machines, but it is likely that program ports would require minimal changes.</p>
		<p>According to the manual, some special functions restricted to these calculators do exist. One such example is the <i>casioplot</i> module, which includes functions for drawing pixels and character strings. Moreover, the PYTHON mode lacks some modules and libraries that would be otherwise included in MicroPython - The manual specifies the existence of the math, random, and casioplot modules in the fx-9750GIII (software version 3.50). I do not know if it is possible to transfer new libraries to the PYTHON mode through the port included in the calculator.</p>
		<p>Another possible advantage of using Python to develop programs in this calculator, is that there are more online resources dedicated to it, and performing the editing on a computer is more trivial than editing Casio BASIC (which uses certain specific symbols and codes for commands), requiring no SDK unless you use functions from the casioplot module, in which case testing programs on a computer becomes more complicated, but perhaps not impossible (see the external links section).</p>

	<p>NOTE: I have not tested this casioplot module on a computer, I really don't know whether that PyPi module is still maintained, or for how long it will continue to be. I'm merely linking it in case it proves to be useful for someone interested.</p>
